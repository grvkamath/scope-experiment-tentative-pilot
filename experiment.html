        <strong>We're conducting an experiment to see whether language AI systems produce natural-sounding continuations to certain kinds of phrases and sentences.</strong>
        In order to make such a judgment we need to first establish a baseline of what are and aren't natural-sounding continuations, using human assessments. 
        This is where you, the experiment-taker, come in.
        You will read some sentences, along with possible continuations. <strong>Your task is to give your opinion on how natural-sounding
          each continuation is.</strong><br>
        <br>
        The experiment will take approximately 15 minutes. Let's start with two examples!

        Great! Now we can start the real experiment. You will now read roughly 20 sentences. 
        Your task is to rate how natural each phrase in blue is as a continuation to each phrase in orange.
        For each continuation, you have the option (if you'd likeâ€”it would help us, but isn't mandatory) to explain, in as few words as you'd like, why it sounds natural or unnatural.
